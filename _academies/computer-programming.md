Computer Programming Academy students will expand their understanding of computer science and computer programming concepts. Students learn the fundamental principles and technology of object-oriented programming and work in a computer lab to gain hands-on programming experience on both individual and team programming projects. Students have the opportunity to make connections with the local professional computer science community and participate in local, national and international programming events. The academy course sequence includes one AP Computer Science Course.
